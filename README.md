# BengkelRobot.net
For the first time introduce myself. My name is Yudi Setiawan. I'm a software engineer in Medan Indonesia.
I am interested in mobile development with Android topics such as Java, Kotlin, and Flutter.
Because, Flutter is a cross platform with good performance so I tried to learn it. And now I can
build web and app with a single code base with Flutter. This is very cool for me.
This repo is my portfolio.

## Important
BengkelRobot.net is under development so, some features cannot be used.
